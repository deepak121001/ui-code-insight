## Installation

**Recommended:** Use as a dev dependency or with npx (preferred for most users):

```bash
npm install --save-dev ui-code-insight
```

Or run directly with npx (no install needed):

```bash
npx ui-code-insight
```

## Quick Start

That's it! Just run the CLI and follow the prompts:

```bash
npx ui-code-insight
```

The CLI will:
1. Ask you to select your project type
2. **Automatically detect** which dependencies are already installed
3. **Prompt you** to install any missing dependencies
4. **Install only what's needed** for your specific project type
5. Generate the reports you select

## Advanced Configuration

### Optional: Create Configuration File

For custom file patterns or advanced settings, create a config file (e.g., `config.json`) in your project root:

```json
{
  "jsFilePathPattern": [
    "./src/**/*.js",
    "./src/**/*.ts",
    "./src/**/*.jsx",
    "./src/**/*.tsx",
    "!./src/**/*.stories.js"
  ],
  "scssFilePathPattern": [
    "./src/**/*.scss",
    "./src/**/*.less",
    "./src/**/*.css",
    "!./node_modules/**"
  ],
  "npmReport": false,
  "recommendedLintRules": false
}
```

**Configuration Options:**
- `jsFilePathPattern`: JS/TS file globs (defaults to common patterns)
- `scssFilePathPattern`: SCSS, LESS, CSS file globs (defaults to common patterns)
- `npmReport`: Enable NPM package report
- `recommendedLintRules`: Use recommended lint rules

## Supported Project Types & ESLint Configs

When prompted, select your project type:
- React
- Node
- Vanilla JS
- TypeScript
- TypeScript + React

Each type uses a dedicated ESLint config in `src/config/` (e.g., `eslintrc.react.json`, `eslintrc.typescript.json`). All configs extend Airbnb and recommended plugins.

## CLI Usage

Run the CLI:

```bash
npx ui-code-insight
```

You will be prompted to select:
- **Project type** (React, Node, Vanilla JS, TypeScript, TypeScript + React, Other)
- **Dependency installation** (automatic detection and installation of missing dependencies)
- **Reports to generate** (ESLint, Stylelint, Package Report, Security Audit, Performance Audit, Accessibility Audit, Testing Audit, Dependency Audit, Comprehensive Audit, All Traditional Reports)

**Prompt navigation:**
- Use **arrow keys** to move.
- Press **spacebar** to select/deselect (multi-select).
- Press **enter** to confirm.

Example prompt flow:
```
? What type of project is this? (Use arrow keys)
‚ùØ React

? Would you like to install all required dependencies for React? (Y/n)
‚ùØ Yes

Installing missing dependencies: eslint-plugin-jsx-a11y eslint-config-airbnb
‚úÖ Dependencies installed successfully!

? Which report(s) do you want to generate? (Press <space> to select, <a> to toggle all, <i> to invert selection)
‚ùØ‚óØ ESLint
 ‚óØ Stylelint
 ‚óØ Package Report
 ‚óØ Security Audit
 ‚óØ Performance Audit
 ‚óØ Accessibility Audit
 ‚óØ Modern Practices Audit
 ‚óØ Testing Audit
 ‚óØ Dependency Audit
 ‚óØ Comprehensive Audit (All Categories)
 ‚óØ All Traditional Reports
```

The tool will use the correct ESLint config and generate the selected reports.

## Comprehensive Code Audits

The tool now includes comprehensive audit categories that go beyond traditional linting:

### üîí Security Audit
- **Hardcoded secrets detection**: Finds passwords, API keys, tokens in code
- **Unsafe eval usage**: Identifies dangerous dynamic code execution
- **XSS vulnerabilities**: Detects potential cross-site scripting issues
- **SQL injection patterns**: Flags potential SQL injection vulnerabilities
- **Dependency vulnerabilities**: Uses npm audit to check for known security issues

### ‚ö° Performance Audit
- **Bundle size analysis**: Checks for large bundle sizes and suggests code splitting
- **Inefficient operations**: Identifies performance anti-patterns
- **Memory leak detection**: Finds potential memory leaks in event listeners and timers
- **Large dependencies**: Flags heavy packages that could impact performance
- **Unused code detection**: Identifies dead code and unused imports

### ‚ôø Accessibility Audit
- **Image accessibility**: Checks for missing alt attributes
- **Heading structure**: Validates proper heading hierarchy
- **Form labels**: Ensures form controls have proper labeling
- **Color contrast**: Flags color usage for manual contrast verification
- **Keyboard navigation**: Checks for keyboard accessibility support
- **ARIA usage**: Validates ARIA attribute implementation

### üß™ Testing Audit
- **Test file detection**: Identifies test files and testing frameworks
- **Test coverage**: Checks for coverage reports and scripts
- **Testing patterns**: Analyzes testing best practices
- **Mocking patterns**: Tracks mocking and stubbing usage
- **E2E testing**: Checks for end-to-end testing setup
- **Test configuration**: Validates testing framework configuration

### üì¶ Dependency Audit
- **Outdated dependencies**: Identifies packages that need updates
- **Duplicate dependencies**: Finds redundant package entries
- **Unused dependencies**: Detects packages that aren't being used
- **Missing dependencies**: Checks for missing packages in node_modules
- **Peer dependencies**: Validates peer dependency requirements
- **License compliance**: Checks for license compatibility issues

### Comprehensive Audit Report
When you select "Comprehensive Audit (All Categories)", the tool runs all audit categories and generates:
- **Detailed JSON report**: `comprehensive-audit-report.json`
- **Summary dashboard**: Console output with issue counts and recommendations
- **Category breakdown**: Issues organized by severity and type
- **Actionable recommendations**: Specific steps to improve your codebase

## Overriding Stylelint Config

To use your own Stylelint configuration:
1. Create a Stylelint config file in your project root (e.g., `.stylelintrc.json`, `.stylelintrc.js`, or `stylelint.config.js`).
2. Set `"recommendedLintRules": false` in your `config.json`.

Example `.stylelintrc.json`:
```json
{
  "extends": "stylelint-config-standard",
  "rules": {
    "color-no-invalid-hex": true
  }
}
```

## Audit Process and Reports

ui-code-insight performs a series of automated audits to help you improve code quality, security, performance, accessibility, testing, and dependency management. Each audit category is implemented as a separate module and can be run individually or as part of a comprehensive audit.

### How the Audit Process Works
1. **Select audits via CLI**: Choose which audits to run (ESLint, Stylelint, Security, Performance, Accessibility, Testing, Dependency, or Comprehensive Audit).
2. **File scanning**: The tool scans your codebase, excluding folders like `node_modules`, `.storybook`, `storybook`, `report`, `build`, and `dist`.
3. **Pattern matching and analysis**: Each audit uses a combination of static analysis, regex patterns, and best-practice checks to find issues.
4. **Report generation**: Results are saved as JSON files in the `report/` directory (e.g., `security-audit-report.json`, `performance-audit-report.json`, `comprehensive-audit-report.json`).
5. **Dashboard visualization**: Open the dashboard to view all audit results, search, filter, and get actionable recommendations.

### Audit Categories
- **Security Audit**: Detects hardcoded secrets, unsafe eval, XSS, SQL injection, and dependency vulnerabilities.
- **Performance Audit**: Flags large bundles, inefficient operations, memory leaks, large dependencies, and unused code.
- **Accessibility Audit**: Checks for missing alt text, heading structure, form labels, color contrast, keyboard navigation, and ARIA usage.
- **Testing Audit**: Detects test files, coverage, best practices, mocking, E2E setup, and test config issues.
- **Dependency Audit**: Finds outdated, duplicate, unused, missing, and problematic dependencies.

### Comprehensive Audit
Selecting "Comprehensive Audit" runs all categories and produces a single, detailed report with a summary, category breakdown, and actionable recommendations.

## Health Score Calculation

The dashboard displays a **Health Score** to give you a quick sense of your project's overall code health.

- **Formula:**
  ```
  Health Score = 100 - totalIssues
  ```
  - `totalIssues` is the sum of all issues found across all audit categories.
  - The score is never less than 0.

- **Interpretation:**
  - 100 = No issues (excellent)
  - 80-99 = Few issues (good)
  - 50-79 = Moderate issues (needs attention)
  - 0-49 = Many issues (high risk)

- **Customizing:** You can adjust the formula to weight high/medium/low severity issues differently if desired.

## AI-Powered Suggestions (Future/Optional)

ui-code-insight is designed to be extensible. In the future, you can integrate AI-powered code suggestions to help resolve issues:

- **How it works:**
  - For each issue, send the code snippet and description to an AI model (e.g., OpenAI GPT-4) via API.
  - Display the AI's suggested fix or explanation in the dashboard.
- **Implementation:**
  - For security, use a backend proxy to call the AI API (do not expose API keys in frontend code).
  - Optionally, allow users to provide their own API key or use a local model for privacy.
- **UI:**
  - Add an "AI Suggestion" button or expandable section for each issue in the dashboard.

*Note: Direct browser integration with OpenAI or similar APIs is not recommended due to API key security. Use a backend proxy or let users provide their own key for demo purposes.*

## Report Generation

- All audit results are saved as JSON files in the `report/` directory.
- The dashboard loads these reports and provides search, filtering, pagination, and context for each issue.
- Each issue includes file, line, severity, message, code snippet, and (where available) code context.

## Removing Modern Practices Audit

The Modern Practices Audit has been removed from the tool and documentation to reflect the current codebase. All other audits remain available and up-to-date.
