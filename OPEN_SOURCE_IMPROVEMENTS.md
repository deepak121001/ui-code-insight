# UI Code Insight - Open Source Improvements Summary

This document summarizes all the improvements made to prepare UI Code Insight for open source release, focusing on industry-standard reporting, clearer dashboards, and better community engagement.

## üéØ Overview

UI Code Insight has been transformed into a comprehensive, open-source-ready code quality and security audit tool with industry-standard reporting, clear dashboards, and robust community infrastructure.

## üìä Key Improvements Made

### 1. **Industry-Standard Report Structure** ‚úÖ
